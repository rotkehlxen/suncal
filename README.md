# Purpose ðŸŒžðŸŒžðŸŒž
Create google calendar with sunrise, sunset, golden hour etc. for specified
location and date(s). To learn about Google APIs, I want to insert events into my personal calendar using api calls.
However, for the common user, this is very cumbersome! You have to register this app in google cloud and obtain 
authentication tokens (see [here](https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/python)) and potentially risk 
hitting the api quota for free use (I have no idea about the limits!).
Potentially useless note: It is also possible to send batch requests (put several API calls into a single HTTP request). 

To avoid all the above mentioned issues, the script should be able to create a .ics calendar file that can be 
imported using the google calendar web interface. 

# Rules for collaborators
If you add a function/class, you also add a corresponding test.

## Specifications

### UI

Intended as a simple command line tool. Use e.g. [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/) to create a 
standalone command line tool and use its functionality to parse command line parameters, check their validity and 
autogenerate documentation (or another tool if there is sth. even fancier out there.)

#### CLI parameters

The following parameters are useful for the dev phase and can be changed for productive runs. For example, 
I might want to create this calendar for a year or two and it would be cumbersome to supply a "from" and "to"
date for this. 

|   parameter  | specs |
|--------------|-------|
| calendar id  | id of target google calendar. Create if it does not exist. |
| from         | "yyyy-mm-dd" from this day ... (default today) |
| to           | "yyyy-mm-dd" to this day ... (default today + 1 week) |
| event        | e.g. "sunrise", for the first draft restrict to choices {"sunrise", "sunset", "goldenhour"} |
| timezone     | e.g. "Europe/Berlin" IANA timezone string (Berlin as default) |
| longitude    | e.g. -122.236355 for Redwood City CA (default Berlin) |
| latitude     | e.g 37.485215 for Redwood City CA (default Berlin) |
| return       | "api" (create events by api call) or "ics" (export ics calendar file) |
